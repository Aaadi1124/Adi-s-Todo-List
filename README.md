# Adi-s-Todo-List
A Todo list lets us make large and overwhelming projects manageable. Once we have a list of things we need to do, it's much easier to prioritize the tasks on it. This will ensure that we are always working on the right things. That is why to prioritize my work and learn something new, I created my own Todo list. It is a purely vanilla JavaScript project.
